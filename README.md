# Basic macOS Initial Setup

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and a bootstrap script to set up a new macOS machine for development in Python, C#, TypeScript, and Go. Additionally, tools for IaaS and container management are included as well. I have not included any particular IDE or editor...you can install what you like from your preferred source. 

## ‚ú® Features

This setup script will:

-   Install **Homebrew** (the macOS package manager).
-   Install and configure **Zsh** as the default shell.
-   Install **Oh My Zsh** for shell management.
-   Install and configure the **Powerlevel10k** theme.
-   Install essential **Oh My Zsh plugins**: `zsh-autosuggestions` and `zsh-syntax-highlighting`.
-   Install a wide array of **CLI tools, languages, and applications** via Homebrew and Homebrew Cask, as defined in the `Brewfile`.
-   Set up **Rust** with `rustup` and install common `cargo` development tools.
-   Set up **Go** and install common `go` development tools.
-   Install specific **Python versions** (3.11, 3.12, 3.13) and `pipx`.
-   Install **C#/.NET SDK** with cross-platform development workloads (MAUI, WASM, Android, iOS).
-   Install **Node.js** (via Homebrew, alongside NVM for version management).
-   Install **TypeScript** and **Yarn** globally.
-   Symlink key configuration files (`.zshrc`, `.p10k.zsh`) from this repository to your home directory.
-   Perform a **post-installation verification** to confirm everything is set up correctly.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up a new macOS machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    Open your Terminal and clone this repository into your home directory. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:n8jja/mac-bootstrap.git ~/mac-bootstrap
    ```

2.  **Run the bootstrap script:**
    Navigate into the cloned directory and execute the `bootstrap.sh` script. This script will handle all installations and configurations.

    ```bash
    cd ~/dotfiles
    chmod +x bootstrap.sh # Make the script executable
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ```

3.  **Restart your terminal:**
    After the script completes, close and reopen your terminal application (or run `exec zsh`) to ensure all new configurations and PATH changes are loaded.

4.  **Configure Powerlevel10k (optional):**
    The first time you open a new terminal, Powerlevel10k might prompt you to run its configuration wizard (`p10k configure`). Follow the prompts to customize your terminal's appearance.
